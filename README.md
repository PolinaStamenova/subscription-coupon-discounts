# Subscription Coupon Discount System

This project implements a **subscription-based system** where users can subscribe to different plans and apply discount coupons. The system ensures proper **coupon usage tracking, prevents race conditions**, and updates pricing both in the application and an external payment provider.

## Features

- **Subscription Management**: Users can subscribe to different plans.
- **Coupon Discounts**: Apply percentage-based discount coupons to subscriptions.
- **Stacking Coupons**: Multiple coupons can be applied to a single subscription.
- **Background Processing**: Uses Sidekiq to notify the external payment provider asynchronously.
- **Coupon Removal**: Removing a coupon restores the subscription price.

## Setup Instructions

### **Prerequisites**
- Ruby `3.2.2`
- Rails `7.1`
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (for Sidekiq)

```

### **Testing**

### **Future Improvements**

- **Implement authentication and authorization (Admin Panel)**

  Adding authentication will allow user-specific experiences, and an admin panel will help manage plans, subscriptions, and coupons securely.

- **Use View Components for reusable and maintainable UI**

  View Components will improve consistency in UI design, reduce duplication, and speed up styling and future UI changes.

- **Introduce coupon expiration logic**

  Currently, coupons do not have expiration dates. Adding this feature will prevent the long-term use of discount codes.

- **Enhance UI/UX for better usability**

  Improve the user interface and overall user experience, ensuring smooth interactions and clarity in applying and removing coupons.

- **Ensure full responsiveness for all screen sizes**

  Adapting the UI to different devices will provide a better experience for users on mobile, tablets, and desktops.
